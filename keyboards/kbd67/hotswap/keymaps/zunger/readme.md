* Custom keymap for kbd67, for those who need to both code and type math.

Layer 0: The layout (somewhat unusually) puts the pause key at the top right; I use this as a fast
screen lock, which is very important when working with and sitting next to security folks.

Backspace and backslash are currently swapped to match my keycaps, but I'm not thrilled about it and
will probably change that after a bit more experimenting.

Escape is in its normal place, and grave between backspace and pause. That latter still feels
suboptimal, but coding really requires fast access to both of these keys, so grave escape isn't
feeling quite right.

Layer 1: This layer deliberately sets KC_NO for the keys it doesn't use. It has RESET at fn-esc, and
various media controls elsewhere.

Layers 2 and 3: These are invoked by the "mathemagic" key (beneath pause) and by magic+shift. The
letters mostly produce Greek; the numbers, superscripts (magic) and subscripts (magic+shift); and
the various other keys, mathematical symbols. There unfortunately aren't nearly enough keys for all
the symbols I'd like, so magic+alt and magic+alt+shift may end up existing as well, giving this a
proper Space Cadet effect; but that said, it's going to be hard to remember where all these symbols
are without some extremely custom keycaps.
